Watch my sped-up clock animation: 

[3d_clock_overlay.mp4](https://github.com/adams-charleen/clock_animation/raw/main/3d_clock_overlay.mp4).

Here’s a GIF version of a broken clock, superimposed on a classic optical illusion—do you see a young woman or an old one? The animation evokes how sleep dwindles with age, and how disrupting our circadian rhythms can accelerate the aging process.
