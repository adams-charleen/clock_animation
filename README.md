# 3D Aging and Circadian Disruption Animation
Watch my sped-up clock animation: [3d_clock_overlay.mp4](https://github.com/adams-charleen/clock_animation/raw/main/3d_clock_overlay.mp4).

But here is a gif version of a broken clock superimposed on a classic illusion. Do you see a young or woman? The animation is intended to capture how we sleep less as we age and how messing with messing with circadian clocks is one way to make us age faster.
